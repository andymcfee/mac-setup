====================

This book covers the basics of setting up a development environment on a new MacBook for most major languages. All instructions covered have been tested on Yosemite. Whether you are an experienced programmer or not, this book is intended for everyone to use as a reference when installing some languages/libraries.

We will set up a [Node][] (JavaScript) environment. Even if you don't program in all four, it is good to have them, as many command-line tools use one of them. We also install a few daily use applications. As you read and follow these steps, feel free to send me any feedback or comments you may have.

All contributions to the book are welcome. Please help add support for other libraries and languages.

**Note:** This book has been generated using [GitBook](http://www.gitbook.io) and is open source, feel free to contribute or signal issues on [GitHub](https://github.com/sb2nov/mac-setup).
