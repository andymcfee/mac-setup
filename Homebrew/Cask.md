# Homebrew Cask

Let's see if we can get the elegance, simplicity, and speed of Homebrew for the installation and management of GUI Mac applications such as Google Chrome and Adium.

### Install

Install Homebrew-cask is really straight forward. We just need to add the cask tap and then install brew cask.

    $ brew install caskroom/cask/brew-cask
    $ brew cask install google-chrome

### Search

It is really simple to check if the app is supported by cask by going to the search page on [caskroom.io](http://caskroom.io/)

### homebrew-cask-versions

Here you'll find alternate versions of Casks for the [homebrew-cask](https://github.com/caskroom/homebrew-cask)
project.

#### Usage

After you install homebrew-cask, run the following command:

```sh
$ brew tap caskroom/versions
```

You can now install alternate versions of Casks.
